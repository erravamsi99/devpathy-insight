# Devpathy â€” The Empathetic Code Reviewer

Devpathy transforms blunt code review comments into empathetic, constructive, and educational guidance.
It ingests a JSON object with a code snippet and review comments, then outputs a well-structured Markdown report
covering: Positive Rephrasing, The Why, and Suggested Improvement (with code examples).

## Features
- ðŸ”¹ Severity-aware tone (supportive â†” direct) based on the language of the comment.
- ðŸ”¹ Category detection (performance, naming, Pythonic truthiness, duplication, complexity, style).
- ðŸ”¹ Concrete code suggestions via pattern-driven snippets.
- ðŸ”¹ Holistic summary + resource links (PEP 8, Python idioms, complexity basics).
- ðŸ”¹ Clean CLI: file or stdin, stdout or file.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m devpathy --input examples/sample_input.json --output report.md
cat report.md
```

### Input JSON shape
```json
{
  "code_snippet": "def get_active_users(users):\n    results = []\n    for u in users:\n        if u.is_active == True and u.profile_complete == True:\n            results.append(u)\n    return results\n",
  "review_comments": [
    "This is inefficient. Don't loop twice conceptually.",
    "Variable 'u' is a bad name.",
    "Boolean comparison '== True' is redundant."
  ]
}
```

### Output
- A single Markdown report to stdout or a specified file.

## Design Notes
- No external API is required. Devpathy uses rule-based analysis to ensure reliable, offline behavior.
- You can extend `rules.py` to add more detections and improvement snippets.
